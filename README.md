## Features

- Enabling `server-sided access token usage` for verifying trades as quick as before on CSMiddler.com. (refreshing access token each 6 hours)

## TODO
- UI with opt-in `server-sided access token usage` and confirmation of understanding risks.
- `client-sided access token usage` - risk free alternative to the server-sided one, but requires both seller and buyer to utilize it. (never trust client)
- Warning when visiting steamcommunity.com-phising sites.
- "List on CSMiddler"-button on own Steam-inventory page.
- `#description=x&items_to_take=xx&items_to_give=xx` parameters in Steam-tradeoffer URL to make it pre-fill.
